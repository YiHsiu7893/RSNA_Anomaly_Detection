>Since chest X-rays (CXRs) are widely used in the diagnosis of thoracic diseases, and existing supervised learning models for diagnostic assistance have issues with high costs and the difficulty of collecting rare disease data, we aim to explore unsupervised learning methods to assist in diagnosis.
>This time, we used three unsupervised learning models to detect abnormalities in chest X-rays
